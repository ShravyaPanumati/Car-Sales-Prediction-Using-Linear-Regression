Car Sales Trend Prediction model aims to analyze the past car sales data and predict the future car sales trend considering different attributes associated with the car.The model uses a dataset that lists car brands, price of the car, mileage of the car, type and model of the car and other characteristics, customers will look while purchasing a car.Using this data set, we have developed a Linear Regression model that aims to predict car sales trend based on different characteristics.
