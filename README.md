**Car Sales Trend Prediction model ** aims to analyze the past car sales data and predict the future car sales trend considering different attributes associated with the car.The model uses a dataset that lists car brands, price of the car, mileage of the car, type and model of the car and other characteristics, customers will look while purchasing a car.Using this data set, we have developed a Linear Regression model that aims to predict car sales trend based on different characteristics.

AWS Service & Components Used:
AWS S3 - Imported the raw source file in the  Amazon S3 bucket.
AWS Glue - Used for data cleaning and  transformation of the raw data as per the requirement.
AWS SageMaker - Used to implement the code, train and test the linear regression model.
Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent features.
Pandas : Used pandas for data analysis and associated manipulation of tabular data in Data Frames
Seaborn :Used seaborn to plot graphs 
Matplotlib:Used this library to create visualizations
Sklearn:Imported this library to do Linear Regression Algorithm
NumPY:Used to perform wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays.
